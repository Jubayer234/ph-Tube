                </h3>
                <p class="text-black font-semibold">
                    <span class="text-orange-500 font-bold">Answer :</span>  These are namely, 'let,' 'var,' and 'const' keywords. Since ES6 standard, the three keywords are available for users to declare variables without initializing them.
                    All three of these keywords have similarities in their syntax for declaring variables. However, they differ in their usage and scope, as detailed in the below.
                    <ul>
                        <li class="mb-4 mt-4 font-medium"><span class="text-orange-500 font-bold">(1) Var :</span> <span class="text-black font-bold"> (i)</span> Variables declared with var are in the function scope. <br>
                            <span class="text-black font-bold">(ii)</span> It gets hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized undefined. <br>
                            <span class="text-black font-bold">(iii) </span> Can be declared without initialization. <br>
                            <span class="text-black font-bold">(iv)</span> Can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-4 font-medium"><span class="text-orange-500 font-bold">(2) Let :</span> <span class="text-black font-bold"> (i)</span> Variables declared as let are in the block scope. <br>
                            <span class="text-black font-bold"> (ii)</span> It also got hoisted to the top of its scope but didn't initialize. <br>
                            <span class="text-black font-bold"> (iii)</span> Can be declared without initialization. <br>
                            <span class="text-black font-bold"> (iv)</span> Cannot be accessed without initialization, leading to 'referenceError'.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-4 font-medium"><span class="text-orange-500 font-bold">(3) Const :</span> <span class="text-black font-bold"> (i)</span> Variables declared as let are in the block scope. <br>
                            <span class="text-black font-bold"> (ii)</span> It also got hoisted to the top of its scope but didn't initialize. <br>
                            <span class="text-black font-bold"> (iii)</span> Cannot be declared without initialization. <br>
                            <span class="text-black font-bold"> (iv)</span> Cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization in the first place.

                    <span class="text-orange-500 font-bold">Answer :</span> Undefined means a variable has been declared but has yet not been assigned a value. <br> Null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.

                <p class="text-black font-semibold mb-4">
                    <span class="text-orange-500 font-bold">Answer :</span>
                    A REST API is a way of easily accessing web services without having excess processing. Whenever a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.
